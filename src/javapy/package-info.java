/**
 * This is the main package where everything in the library should be located.
 * It then descends from here, in sub-packages, all grouped by type. Those
 * groupings should then go to classes with relevant names to their function and
 * their operability inside the package. We encourage method overloading, and we
 * ask that methods are not repeated in functionality, and that methods which
 * have similar functions draw upon the same algorithmic base.
