        <h1>JavaPy</h1>

<p>Many methods for random functions! It is built as a library for people to reference methods and algorithms from. It is all open source, and is provided with documentation. In the case that you'd actually like to use this library (which is basically guaranteed to expand as time moves on), just clone it down - then set your build path in Eclipse to be part of a project (this one). It should then work from there.</p>

<p>There should be no main methods inside this programme. It should all be referenced from outside, and there should be no "try { } catch { }"'s either, as the programme is a library of extensions, all of which should allow the programmer to deal with their exceptions by themselves.</p>
